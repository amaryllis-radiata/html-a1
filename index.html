      Currently I reside at Bexley Books, where recently has merged with Gaman
      publishing co. My job as Chief Executive Assistant involves overseeing
      operations and managing team performance. Yet apparently falling head over
      heels with the woman I'm supposedly fighting against for Chief Operating
      Officer (COO) is included too.
